# Task Registration and Prediction REST API
The goal of this REST API is to register tasks and use the data to make predictions. A task can be any piece of code with a given set of input that runs on a given set of resources. Therefore, a workflow can be made of multiple tasks. The idea is to give the user flexibility to use the REST API as needed for whatever tasks are defined.

To run the tests:
1. Start the REST API: `python application.py`
2. Run the tests: `python test.py`


See `run_dummy_task.py` for a usage example.
